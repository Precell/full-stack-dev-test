# FULL STACK TEST

- Your task is to produce an API that returns a list of products and render them in React
- NO authentication or rate limiting implementation of any sort is required
- You are free to take advantage of any NPM packages that are available to assist you
- This repository is split into backend and frontend
- The backend folder contains a database in the form of a JSON file called DB.json
- The backend folder also contains a sub folder with all of the product images. You are free to  either serve them from the Node backend or with a different service
- The API endpoint should have an appropriate name and take use of the GET method
- The frontend folder is a React app that must consume your backend and render a column of product (vertical).
